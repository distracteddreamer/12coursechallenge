# 12 course challenge

## Introduction
This is a challenge to complete 12 challenging courses in 6 months. I will focus on courses which are 

- Technical, with an emphasis on mathematical content.
- Advanced wherever possible i.e. upper-undergraduate-level or graduate-level wherever possible rather than introductory.
- Based on those taught in top universities rather than online courses unless these are virtually identical to the ones their students take (for example MITx courses on edX).

## Challenges
By the end of June 2020 I will:
- [ ] Make a preliminary list of courses
- [ ] Write more about the challenge
